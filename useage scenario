I propose the theory that a hybrid key derivation scheme was used in key generation, thusly making brute forcing of key spaces beyond 2^64 reasonably viable endeavors and in consideration of reducing the environmental impact in energy use. This hybrid model is consists of manually establishing solvable-by-logic leading bytes of unknown length, the remainder of the key being ecdsa/bip32 derived trailing bytes from a masked 77 digit integer to be brute-forced.
The logic in leading byte creation shows evidence of having several schemes: being dynamic prevents one person from taking all of the fruit, keeping things fair.

During reverse engineering experiments on known keys I would like to share what I propose
to be at least one of several approach angles. Perhaps this can be probed and further insights
and more meaning discovered:  

     Potential logic used for deriving leading bytes for key 66 from key 65 using the hash160 of its compressed and            
          uncompressed public key(s)
 

Start with setting the target:

pk#66 dec                             pk#65 dec
46346217550346335726 -30568377312064202855 = 15777840238282132871 ( target)

let us now determine how the value 15777840238282132871 was calculated:


Pk # 65 in 32 byte hex
0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001a838b13505b26867

convert each hash 160 string (from hex) to decimal, 8 times consecutively:

subtract compressed output value from the uncompressed value

result:
8622195785462901804601365923152084548773021951224032440491366798926698413788707 6015412435628324522922321583529688082996580255448288200088036569652021563561611 22095040030428976

  mod the output against the denominator ( output becomes new numerator mod the compressed large int )

 of interest:
The integers may be intended to be a fractional in decimal starting from the ten thousandth point place. This theory derives from noting that .00001000 satoshi was sent to every 5th addresses starting from 2^65. let us consider, then how this furthers the theory:

Maybe im just seeing what I want to see, but the math is indisputable.
As far as cooincidencial dismissal goes, Im going to stay here for a while.
Have fun.
